# CustomDataValidityGem




Ruby gem designed to provide flexible validation methods for common data types like email addresses, phone numbers, and postal codes. This gem is meant for use in Ruby applications where custom data validation is required.

To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
gem build custom-data-validity-gem.gemspec
gem install custom-data-validity-gem-0.1.0.gem
```

## Usage

```bash
require 'custom_data_validity_gem'
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
